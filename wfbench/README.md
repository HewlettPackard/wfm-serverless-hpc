This is an extension of the WfCommons project: https://github.com/wfcommons/WfCommons

More specifically, it is a new Translator component (https://github.com/wfcommons/WfCommons/tree/main/wfcommons/wfbench/translator). It translates the workflows generated to Knative, an Open-source Serverless Platform.
